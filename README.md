# Frontend for Iz-NC-News

Welcome to Iz-NC-News. This is a demonstration of a news app. You can find the link to the deployed site here: 
https://iz-nc-news.netlify.app/articles

## The app

Imagine the site is a news site. Currently, the site's main mode of interaction is articles. In the current iteration they are pre-filled with generic articles from a database.

Articles can be read, and they can accept votes (up or down) and comments from users. Users can also delete their own comments.

Users can view articles filtered by topics. They can also sort the article list (filtered or unfiltered) by votes, comment count, date created, and choose ascending or descending order.

To use the app, try navigating the site. Current implementation is a generic logged-in user, chosen from the database as 'jess-jelly'. Adding articles was added to the frontend on 23/01/24, with integration with backend planned.
